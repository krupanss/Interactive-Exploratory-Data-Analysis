            methods to understand and summarize a dataset without making any assumptions about 
            its contents. It is usually used to investigate a specific question or to prepare 
            for more advanced modeling. EDA typically relies heavily on visualizing the data to 
            assess patterns and identify data characteristics that the analyst would not 
            otherwise know to look for. It also takes advantage of a number of quantitative 
            methods to describe the data."),

            appropriate model for the problem at hand and to correctly interpret its results.

            generating accurate models but on the wrong data, not creating the right types of 
            variables in data preparation, and using resources inefficiently because of 
            realizing only after generating models that perhaps the data is skewed, or has
